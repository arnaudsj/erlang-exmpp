	The whole project uses the Autotools now.

	* include/exmpp.hrl: Add a prefix member to xmlnselement record. Add
	an xmlattr record to handle attribute (with namespace support).

	* src/exmpp_xml.erl: New API (more consistent) with better namespace
	support (even for attributes). There's a compatibility layer for the
	old API, which can be enabled by defining WITH_DEPRECATED_API at
	compile time.

	* c_src/expat_drv.c: Imporve namespace support, especially for
	attributes. Add an option to put element and attribute name as
	atom().

	* c_src/tls_drv.c (tls_drv_control): Fixed a warning about different
	types in an affectation.

	* testsuite/: Add a testsuite.
