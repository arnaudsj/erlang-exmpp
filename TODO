Possible bugs
-------------

o  Fix maxsize handling in the parser.
o  Fix character data handling above 'root_depth'.
o  lists:keystore/4 appeared with Erlang R12B.



Improvements
------------

None.


New features
------------

o  Add equivalents to lists:filter/2 and lists:foldl/3 to exmpp_xml
o  exmpp_xml should feed its namespaces/names/attributes tables from the
   application environment. When a process/module doesn't have access
   to all the parser instances, this is the only way to declare its own
   names. A new option should enable/disable this behavious.
