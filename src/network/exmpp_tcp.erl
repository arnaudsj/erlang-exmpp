%% if we use active-once before spawning the receiver process,
%% we can receive some data in the original process rather than
%% in the receiver process. So {active,once} is is set explicitly
%% in the receiver process. NOTE: in this case this wouldn't make
%% a big difference, as the connecting client should send the
%% stream header before receiving anything

% we do a synchronous shutdown of the receiver process, 
% because we want to make sure it isn't going be pushing
% more data to the exmpp_xmlstream after closed. This
% avoid the -useless- crash reports produced when the 
% receiver process read data from socket before received
% the stop message, but after the xmlstream was closed.
% See shutdown order in exmpp_tcp:terminate/3.
